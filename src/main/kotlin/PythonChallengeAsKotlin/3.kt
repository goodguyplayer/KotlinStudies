Here's what we'll do.
    - Load file with the text in it.
    - Create a list that will take all possible characters
    - For every character found in it, count how many of those there are. Store in list, then remove the character from string
    - Considering we're meant to "find rare characters", will make list print only those characters that shows 40 times or less.

    - Rather, we don't /need/ to save the characters. We can just count and pop them out.
